## Problem Statement

The modern workforce and lifelong learners face three critical challenges:  
- Skill Gaps: Rapid technological advancements make it difficult for individuals to acquire relevant skills independently.  
- Inefficient Mentorship: Traditional mentorship relies on personal networks, limiting access for underrepresented groups and remote learners.  
- Fragmented Resources: Existing platforms focus on static content (e.g., pre-recorded courses) or generic forums, lacking personalized, interactive guidance.
  # This results in: 
- Stagnated career growth for professionals/students.  
- Underutilized expertise from potential mentors.  
- High dropout rates in self-directed learning due to isolation.
